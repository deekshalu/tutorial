<p> This is my life in Harry Potter. 
I love Harry Potter soo soo soo soo much. It has always been something that I loved to read and connect with. I love the cast of the movies and how they were able to capture the magic in the books and bring them to the big screen. Because of Harry Potter, Emma Watson became one my most favorite actress and human being of all time. </p>
